            The beginnings of Photography
          </figcaption>
          <p>
            The history of photography has roots in remote antiquity with the discovery of two critical principles, that of the camera obscura (darkened or obscured room or chamber) and the fact that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light, as discovered by observation. As far as is known, nobody thought of bringing these two phenomena together to capture camera images in permanent form until around 1800, when Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt. In the mid-1820s, Nicéphore Niépce succeeded, but several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very crude.

Niépce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced and commercially viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. It was commercially introduced in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography. The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot.

Subsequent innovations made photography easier and more versatile. New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds, and eventually to a small fraction of a second; new photographic media were more economical, sensitive and/or convenient, including roll films for casual use by amateurs. In the mid-20th century, developments made it possible for amateurs to take pictures in natural color as well as in black-and-white.

The commercial introduction of computer-based electronic digital cameras in the 1990s soon revolutionized photography. During the first decade of the 21st century, traditional film-based photochemical methods were increasingly marginalized as the practical advantages of the new technology became widely appreciated and the image quality of moderately priced digital cameras was continually improved.

            Cameras today
          </figcaption>
          <p>
            Digital Slr Cameras: (aka Digital Single Lens Reflex Cameras or DSLR cameras): Digital SLR cameras are the most versatile and advanced type cameras available on the consumer market.
          </p>
          <p>
            ​Compact Digital Cameras: Digital compact cameras, which are also known as Point and Shoot cameras, vary in features, price, and styles. Their smaller size and ease of use is the main appeal of these types of digital cameras.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bridge Compact Digital Cameras/Super Zoom Cameras: Bridge cameras, also known as Advanced Compact cameras are a step up from the Basic Compact camera.
            The main difference between Bridge cameras and Basic Compact cameras is that they allow the photographer to have more control over the camera's exposure settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compact System Cameras/Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras: These types of digital cameras are very similar to Digital Slr cameras. Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens cameras allow the photographer to use the camera in full manual, automatic, or semi-automatic modes the same way Digital Slr cameras can be operated.
            Their camera body size is closer to the size of compact cameras. The reason the body size is so much smaller is because they do not have optical viewfinders like the Digital Slr cameras.

            Social Media
          </figcaption>
          <p>
            Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Flickr, Tumblr, Twitter, the list goes on. Our lives are flooded with social media, and what is one of the best parts of it?Photos, pictures, pic-stiches, snaps. The internet is overflowing with images taken, edited, and posted by users. It is amazing when you stop to think about how many photos are uploaded to websites.
            What does this mean for photography? Sure, some would say it is destroying the art form of photography, that it does an injustice to real professional photographers out there. But I would like to argue that social media is helping more than it is hurting us photographers. Take, for example, the fact that large interconnected platforms have created the best potential for photographers to display their work to the world.
            The opposition argues that photography used to be an art form, and the few photos people had were more significant because of their scarcity. Photographs used to be something to cherish. A good piece of photography even more so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some might say that because society is being bombarded by so many images, we have become more aware of good photography, photographers who consider themselves professionals can easily get ahead of the less-knowledgeable amateurs out there. Think about it, people are automatically drawn to incredible photography. Why do you think businesses spend millions of dollars every year in photographic advertisements? If a photographer wants to promote him or herself, all he or she has to do is put high quality photos out there. Those photos will easily surpass the low quality photos that 13-year-old posted with an iPhone.
            Change is uncomfortable and sometimes we just want to hold on to tradition and what we know. But whether or not you approve, social media has and will continue to change photography. That’s just the way it is. So you can either hang back and complain that photography is getting worse, and social media is destroying the art form, or you can jump on the new opportunities to create new and original things as a true artist would.
